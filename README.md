# TyporaCrack

Typora is a lightweight Markdown editor developed by Abner Lee, suitable for three operating systems: OS X, Windows, and Linux. Unlike other Markdown editors, Typora does not adopt the dual-column display of source code and preview. Instead, it utilizes a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing approach, achieving real-time preview functionality. However, it also allows switching to the source code editing mode.

The software currently offers a 15-day free trial, and subsequent usage requires a valid license. Visit https://typora.io/ for more information.

This project bypasses the paywall by modifying files, allowing free usage of Typora and supporting the latest version.
